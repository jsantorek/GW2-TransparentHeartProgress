### Functionality
The Transparent Heart Progress addon provides a detailed and visually appealing display of renown heart progression in Guild Wars 2. It enhances the default UI by showing precise progress percentage with precision of two decimal places that integrates seamlessly with the game's interface. This data is already available to all users (graphically, in form of bar only) or to other party members (as hover tooltip) thus making addon ToS compliant.

### Features:
- Displays renown heart progress as a percentage
- Minimalistic, lightweight and easy to use

### Notes
- After enabling the addon you might need to leave and re-enter Renown Heart.
- Known issue with ArcDPS unofficial extras: <span style="color:red;">Failed to inject hook 35</span>. Reportadly related to its hide hearts option, no known workaround.
